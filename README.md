# RestaurantNameGenerator

A Python project that generates creative restaurant names and menu items based on a given cuisine. This project uses LangChain for chaining together language models to generate restaurant names and their respective menu items.

## Features

- **Restaurant Name Generator**: Given a cuisine, the model generates a creative name for a restaurant.
- **Menu Items Generator**: For a given restaurant name, the model generates a list of menu items.
- **Easy Setup**: The project uses LangChain and OpenAI to make it easy to generate restaurant-related content.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**:
   To generate a restaurant name and menu items, run the `main.py` file. For example, to generate content for an Italian restaurant:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Example usage within the script:
   ```python
   from LangchainHelper import generate_restaurantname_and_items
   print(generate_restaurantname_and_items("Italian"))
   ```

   This will output a restaurant name and some menu items for an Italian cuisine restaurant.

### Customizing the Generator
You can easily modify the prompt templates in `LangchainHelper.py` to generate restaurant names and menu items for different cuisines. Just update the templates and add more chains if you want additional features!
